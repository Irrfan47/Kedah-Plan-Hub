# Query Tab Edit Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### 1. **Removed Upload Button from Edit Modal**
**Problem**: Upload button was present in the edit modal, but all changes should only take effect when clicking "Update Program"
**Solution**: ✅ Removed the entire "Add New Document" section from the edit modal

### 2. **Document Upload Issue**
**Problem**: Program editing was not working when adding new documents (but changing budget/program name worked)
**Solution**: ✅ Removed the upload functionality from the edit modal to prevent conflicts

## Changes Made

### 1. src/pages/Query.tsx
- **Removed "Add New Document" section** from the edit modal
- **Removed upload button** and file input from edit modal
- **Kept document viewing and deletion** functionality intact
- **Maintained program information editing** (name, budget, recipient, reference)

## Current Edit Modal Features

### ✅ What Works:
- **Program Name** editing
- **Budget** editing  
- **Recipient Name** editing
- **EXCO Letter Reference** editing
- **Document viewing** (view/download existing documents)
- **Document deletion** (delete existing documents)
- **Update Program** button (saves all changes)

### ❌ What Was Removed:
- **Document upload** functionality (removed from edit modal)
- **Upload button** (no longer present)

## Reasoning

The upload button was removed because:
1. **Consistency**: All changes should only take effect when clicking "Update Program"
2. **Simplicity**: Prevents conflicts between immediate upload and program update
3. **User Experience**: Clearer workflow - edit program details, then update

## Alternative for Document Upload

If users need to upload documents, they should:
1. Use the separate "View Documents" modal (which has upload functionality)
2. Or upload documents through the main Program Management page

## Testing Steps

1. **Test Program Information Editing**:
   - Edit program name, budget, recipient name, reference number
   - Click "Update Program"
   - Verify changes are saved

2. **Test Document Operations**:
   - View existing documents
   - Download existing documents  
   - Delete existing documents
   - Verify document operations work correctly

3. **Verify Upload Button Removed**:
   - Confirm no upload button appears in edit modal
   - Confirm no file input appears in edit modal

## Expected Results

- ✅ Program information editing works correctly
- ✅ Document viewing and deletion works correctly
- ✅ No upload button in edit modal
- ✅ All changes only take effect when clicking "Update Program"
- ✅ Clean, consistent user experience
